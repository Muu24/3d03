Some note for Stats 3d03 fall, 2017

This is a course taught by Prof. Balakrishnan and I was the TA for it. through that semester, I wrote some answers for the questions in the book <Introduction to Mathematical Statistics> and save it as this permanent link. If you find mistakes please feel free to let me know, I am sure that there are many typos.

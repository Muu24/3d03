Some note for Stats 3d03 fall, 2017
This is a course taught by Prof. Balakrishnan and I was the TA for it, throught that semester, I wrote some notes for the questions in the book <Introduction to Mathematical Statistics> so that I just move them to a permanent link. If you find mistakes please feel free to let me know, I am sure that there are many typos.
